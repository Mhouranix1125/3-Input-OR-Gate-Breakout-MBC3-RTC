# OR_IC_Breakout_Board
Utilizes the 74LVC1G332GV,125 OR Gate IC Pinouts on a neat board, and allows one to solder wires via through holes that connect to the pinouts. 
Notes:
1). You will need to source the IC chip yourself. I highly recommend DigiKey or Mouser.
2). There is a space on the board for a 0.1UF capacitor to handle noise. Utilize to your liking. Sizes 0602, or 0805 will fit fine.
